Refactors:
- Fix bug on method room_available?
- Distribute better methods in hotel_organizer (better OO DESGN)
- Add Wave3: Hotel blocks
- Add more tests for edge cases
- Check optional enhancements - hopefully some day :)


Revisiting Hotel:
- How easy is it to follow your own instructions?
- Do these refactors improve the clarity of your code?
- Do you still agree with your previous assessment, or could your refactor be further improved?
